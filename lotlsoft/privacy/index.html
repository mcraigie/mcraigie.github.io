    <h1>Lotlsoft Privacy Policy</h1>

    This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when
    you install and use Piksi (the “App”).

    <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    When you use the App, we automatically collect certain information about your device, IP
    address, and time zone. Additionally, as you use the App, we collect information about the
    individual screens you view, and information about how you interact with the App. We refer to
    this automatically-collected information as “Analytics.” When we talk about “Personal
    Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking about this Analytics information.

    <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

    We use the Analytics that we collect to improve and optimize our App.

    <h2>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

    We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information,
    as described above. We use Google Firebase to help us understand how our customers use the
    App--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:
    https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. Finally, we may also share your Personal
    Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search
    warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

    <h2>CHANGES</h2>
    We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to
    our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.

    <h2>CONTACT US</h2>
    For more information about our privacy practices, if you have questions, or if you would like to
