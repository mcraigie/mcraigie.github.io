    <h1>Lotlsoft Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared
      when you install and use Piksi (the “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    <p>
      When you use the App, we automatically collect certain information about your device, IP
      address, and time zone. Additionally, as you use the App, we collect information about the
      individual screens you view, and information about how you interact with the App. We refer to
      this automatically-collected information as “Analytics Information.”
    </p>

    <p>
      If you choose to leave feedback inside the App, you may decide if you would like to share you
      name and email. We refer to this information as "Feedback Contact Information"
    </p>

    When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking about Analytics
    Information and Feedback Contact Information.

    <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

    <p>We use the Analytics Information that we collect to improve and optimize our App.</p>

    <p>
      We will only ever use Feedback Contact Information to contact you regarding your feedback.
    </p>

    <h2>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

    <p>
      We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal
      Information, as described above.
    </p>

    We use Google Firebase to help us understand how our customers use the App -- you can read more
    about how Google uses your Personal Information here:
    https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.

    <p>We use Typeform to collect your feedback.</p>

    <p>
      Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and
      regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information
      we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
    </p>

    <h2>CHANGES</h2>

    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes
      to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
